# SQL-Project

Hi there!

This is my SQL Project 1.

All the dataset, ER diagrams and database used in this SQL project were obtained from a Coursera course: "SQL for Data Science" (University of California, Davis)

Link to see the course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science

I've done an exploratary analysis using basic to advanced SQL queries. I used SQLite saerver which was embedded together & can be accessed within the Coursera course and all the analysis were done there.

Feel free to give comments or feedback for my project.

Thanks!
